    <h2 class="subsection">Grilled Shrimp with Old Bay and Aioli</h2>

    <p>You can't go wrong with this grilled shrimp recipe if you want something delicious and fast. With only a few ingredients you can pair this shrimp up with a side dish and have dinner ready in less than an hour.</p>
    <p>Seasoned with Old Bay, a little garlic and some lemons, these grilled shrimp give off a classic East Coast vibe. I recommend you keep the shell on, the crunchy texture and flavor add so much to this dish.</p>
